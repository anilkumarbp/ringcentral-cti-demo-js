## Getting Started

The full installation instructions are included as an HTML file in the demo itself. You can view the [full installation instructions on the live demo](http://grokify.github.io/cti-demo/instructions.html).

Since this runs live on GitHub Pages, you can run this demo without any server-side installation, though it may be worthwhile to install the RingCentral for Desktop softphone as described in the instructions.

You can also run this demo on any webserver by adding the `public` directory to the server's html directory. This may be useful if you wish to edit the pages. There is no need to run a database as the demo stores all necessary data using HTML5 Local Storage (e.g. `window.localStorage`). Instructions are provided below for Node.js http-server as one easy approach for this.

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-cti-demo-js
$ cd ringcentral-cti-demo-js
$ bower install ringcentral --save
$ bower install ringcentral-helpers --save
```

The included `.bowerrc` file will save components to the `public/components` directory.

### Using Node.js http-server

You can run this demo using any server that can host static webpages, including GitHub pages.

Using Node.js and `http-server` ([NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) is presented as one easy to use option.

#### Pre-reqs

Install NPM globally:

```
$ curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh
```

Install `http-server` globally so it cna be run from the command line.

```
$ npm install http-server -g
```

Install and run demo.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-cti-demo-js
$ http-server ringcentral-cti-demo-js/public
```

Navigate Google Chrome to the location sepcified by `http-server`, e.g.

```
http://localhost:8080
```
